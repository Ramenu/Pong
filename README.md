A Pong game made in Python.

UPDATE 
-------
- Ball doesn't bounce in the same direction anymore (pseudo-randomized now)
- Speed of the ball changes based on the score count (a higher score makes it move faster) 


HOW TO RUN
----------

1) Make sure you have the Python interpreter installed (see https://www.python.org/)

2) Add the Python interpreter into your environment variables

3) cd to the "Pong" directory and type "python ./src/main.py"

If all the steps were done correctly, you should see a game of Pong open up! :)
