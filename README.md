A Pong game made in Python.
Cannot release the audio files, font, and the icon because of the copyright issues.

HOW TO RUN
----------

1) Make sure you have the Python interpreter installed (see https://www.python.org/)

2) Add the Python interpreter into your environment variables

3) cd to the "Pong" directory and type "python ./src/main.py"

If all the steps were done correctly, you should see a game of Pong open up! :)

KNOWN BUGS:
- Ball will bounce back and forth in the same direction after a few hits with the paddle

I may or may not update this in the future.
